# Release notes

Chronological record of provider-remediation support added to `dns-scripts`. Each
provider is pure data in [`records.json`](records.json); both front-ends (the
`verify_thundermail_dns.py` CLI and the `index.html`/`app.js` web app) pick it up
automatically. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the onboarding workflow
and the verification bar every provider is held to.

## ⚠️ Pending verification

**`spaceship` is unverified.** To promote it (do this when you have a live Spaceship
panel open):

1. Open the panel and click **+ Add record** for one record of each type
   (MX / SRV / TXT / CNAME) — the *manual* form, not the zone-import preview.
2. Confirm three things:
   - The exact field labels in the add form (is it `Host` or `Hostname`? etc.).
   - ~~**SRV host** — one field or split?~~ **Resolved 2026-07-14:** Spaceship's
     public API models SRV with a single combined `name` (`_caldavs._tcp`), not a
     split service/protocol — so the combined form we ship is correct (see the
     `spaceship` notes below). The import-preview split was a UI display quirk.
   - Whether CNAME/MX targets need a trailing dot (the import preview stored one).
3. Fix `records.json` if anything differs, then remove the `UNVERIFIED —` prefixes
   from the four `spaceship` headers, and delete the unverified notes in
   [`README.md`](README.md) and the `spaceship` section below.

Details and reasoning are in the [`spaceship` notes](#spaceship-spaceshipcom--unverified).

**`godaddy` is unverified.** To promote it (do this when you have a live GoDaddy
panel open):

1. Open **DNS → DNS Records → Add New Record** and pick each Type
   (MX / SRV / TXT / CNAME) in turn.
2. Confirm three things:
   - The exact field labels in the add form (the SRV form screenshot shows
     `Type / Service / Protocol / Name / Value / Priority / Weight / Port`; check
     the MX/TXT/CNAME forms match `Type / Name / Priority / Value` etc.).
   - **Apex Name** is entered as `@` (what we ship), not left blank.
   - Whether CNAME/MX/SRV targets (Value) need a trailing dot.
3. Fix `records.json` if anything differs, then remove the `UNVERIFIED —` prefixes
   from the four `godaddy` headers, and delete the unverified notes in
   [`README.md`](README.md) and the `godaddy` section below.

Details and reasoning are in the [`godaddy` notes](#godaddy-godaddycom--unverified).

**`ionos` is unverified.** To promote it (do this when you have a live IONOS panel
open):

1. Open **Domains & SSL → gear next to the domain → DNS → ADD RECORD** and pick each
   Type (MX / SRV / TXT / CNAME) in turn. CNAME is reached via **Manage Subdomains →
   gear on the subdomain → DNS** instead.
2. Confirm three things:
   - The exact field labels in the add form (the SRV form screenshot shows
     `Type / Service / Protocol / Host name / Points to / Priority / Weight / Port`;
     check MX/TXT match `Host name / Points to / Value` and CNAME uses
     `Hostname / Point to`).
   - **Apex Host name** is entered as `@` (what we ship) for MX/TXT, not left blank.
   - Whether the SRV **Protocol** dropdown offer matches `TCP` and whether any target
     needs a trailing dot (the CNAME doc says enter it without one).
3. Fix `records.json` if anything differs, then remove the `UNVERIFIED —` prefixes
   from the four `ionos` headers, and delete the unverified notes in
   [`README.md`](README.md) and the `ionos` section below.

`ionos.example.com` is already correctly configured on IONOS, so it is a ready-made
target: `verify_thundermail_dns.py ionos.example.com` should report 13/13.

Details and reasoning are in the [`ionos` notes](#ionos-ionoscom--unverified).

**`ovh` is unverified.** To promote it (do this when you have a live OVHcloud panel
open):

1. Open **Web Cloud → DNS zones → your domain → DNS zone → Add an entry** and pick each
   type (MX / SRV / TXT / CNAME) in turn.
2. Confirm three things:
   - The exact field labels in each wizard (the TXT/SPF wizard screenshot shows
     `Sub-domain / TTL / Value`; the **MX** and **SRV** wizards were **not**
     screenshotted — verify their labels and, for SRV, whether Priority/Weight/Port/
     Target are separate fields or one combined string).
   - **Apex Sub-domain** is left **empty** (what we ship), not `@`.
   - Whether **MX and SRV targets need a trailing dot** (we ship one on all FQDN
     targets, since the docs say OVH appends your domain to an unpunctuated target;
     the CNAME trailing dot is documented, MX/SRV is inferred).
3. Fix `records.json` if anything differs, then remove the `UNVERIFIED —` prefixes
   from the four `ovh` headers, and delete the unverified notes in
   [`README.md`](README.md) and the `ovh` section below.

`ovh.example.com` is already correctly configured on OVH (NS `ns200.anycast.me`), so it is a
ready-made target: `verify_thundermail_dns.py ovh.example.com` should report 13/13, and
`--resolver ns200.anycast.me` queries OVH authoritatively.

Details and reasoning are in the [`ovh` notes](#ovh-ovhcloudcom--unverified).

## Notes

### `bunny` (bunny.net)

Added 2026-07-13. First drafted from a record-list screenshot (the `bunny.example.com`
zone), then **corrected and verified** the same day against bunny.net's official
docs ([DNS records](https://docs.bunny.net/docs/dns-records)). The confirmed
conventions:

- The add-record dialog is a **single form** with a **Type** dropdown (not per-type
  sections like Cosmotown) and fields **Hostname / Type / TTL / Value**.
- **Hostname** is left **empty for the root domain** (the `subhost` pattern) — never
  `@`; bunny lists apex records under the full domain name.
- There is **one Value field with no separate Priority / Weight / Port fields**, so
  MX and SRV put the whole record string in Value (`{match}`) — e.g. MX
  `10 mail.thundermail.com`, SRV `0 1 443 mail.thundermail.com`. The record-list
  screenshot corroborated this (MX displayed as `10 mail.thundermail.com`).
- The record list's **Weight** column is bunny's A/AAAA load-balancing "Routing
  Weight" (0-100, under Advanced Settings), **not** the SRV weight — so it does not
  factor into any of the Thundermail records.

Corrections made from the initial screenshot-only draft: the field is **Hostname**
(not "Name"); MX/SRV use a single **Value** (not separate Priority/Weight/Port);
dropped the unverified CNAME "no trailing dot" note.

**Live validation (2026-07-13):** ran the CLI against the real bunny.net-hosted
`bunny.example.com` (delegated to `kiki`/`coco.bunny.net`) → **13/13 passed, exit 0**.
Driven by Zendesk ticket [6750](https://tbpro.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/6750).
Every value bunny.net serves matches the expected strings byte-for-byte, including
`MX 10 mail.thundermail.com` and `SRV 0 1 443 mail.thundermail.com` — confirming the
single-`Value`-field (`{match}`) remediation produces exactly what the panel stores.

### `spaceship` (spaceship.com) — unverified

Added 2026-07-13 for Zendesk ticket
[6672](https://tbpro.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/6672). Marked **unverified** because
the two sources only partly cover it:

- A **zone-import preview** screenshot from the real `cosmotown.example.com` zone
  (CONTRIBUTING artifact type 2, and specifically the *import* view — not the
  higher-priority manual add-record form, type 1).
- Spaceship's official docs
  ([Required DNS records for Spacemail](https://www.spaceship.com/knowledgebase/spacemail-dns-records-third-party-domain/)),
  which document **Spacemail's own** records (`mx1.spacemail.com`, …), a *different*
  record set — so they confirm the panel's column labels but not the Thundermail
  entries.

What the sources agree on and we encoded:

- Columns are **Host / Type / Value / TTL** (docs call Host "Hostname"); the panel
  auto-appends the domain to Host and uses **`@` for the root** (not blank).
- **MX** has a separate **Priority** field alongside the target Value.
- **SRV** breaks out **Priority / Weight / Port / Target** as separate fields.
- The provider headers themselves carry an `UNVERIFIED` prefix so CLI/web users see
  the caveat inline.

Still **unverified** against a live manual add-record form:

- Exact field labels in the *add* form (vs. the import preview).
- Whether CNAME/MX targets need a trailing dot (the import view showed them stored
  with one).

**SRV host — resolved 2026-07-14.** The import view split the SRV host into
`_caldavs` + `_tcp` (service + protocol) fields, which cast doubt on the combined
`_caldavs._tcp` we ship. Reading Spaceship's public API DNS model settles it: the API
represents an SRV record with a **single combined `name`** (e.g. `_caldavs._tcp`) plus
separate `priority` / `weight` / `port`, with **no split service/protocol** — confirmed
against [docs.spaceship.dev](https://docs.spaceship.dev/) and the `dns.ts` schema in the
community MCP server [`hlebtkachenko/spaceship-mcp`](https://github.com/hlebtkachenko/spaceship-mcp)
(generic `name` / value / `priority` / `weight` / `port` per record). So the combined
`_caldavs._tcp` is correct at the data level and the split was a display quirk of the
*import* view. (Contrast `godaddy`, whose *manual add form* genuinely splits Service and
Protocol into separate inputs — a UI-layout difference, not a difference in the stored
record.)

A community Spaceship **MCP server** (wraps the REST API; auth via
`SPACESHIP_API_KEY` / `SPACESHIP_API_SECRET`) can drive a *functional* verification —
create the 13 Thundermail records via its `ss_dns_save` tool on a live Spaceship-hosted
domain, then `verify_thundermail_dns.py <domain> --resolver <Spaceship NS> --provider
spaceship` should report 13/13 (same approach that validated `bunny` against
`bunny.example.com`). That would confirm the record **values** and the combined-`name`
decision, but the API is a different surface than the manual web form, so it still
wouldn't nail the form's field **labels** (item 1) or the trailing-dot UI behavior
(item 3) — a screenshot of the live add form remains the way to fully promote.

To promote to verified: capture the manual add-record form for one record of each
type, confirm the field sets, then drop the `UNVERIFIED` prefixes in `records.json`
and the note here and in [`README.md`](README.md).

### `godaddy` (godaddy.com) — unverified

Added 2026-07-14 for internal ticket 6850 (`6850_GODADDY_CUSTOM_DOMAIN`). Marked
**unverified**: the conventions come from GoDaddy's official help articles plus a
screenshot of the live **SRV** add-record form, but haven't been confirmed end-to-end
by adding all 13 records on a live GoDaddy-hosted domain. Sources:
[MX](https://www.godaddy.com/en-ca/help/add-an-mx-record-19234),
[TXT](https://www.godaddy.com/en-ca/help/add-a-txt-record-19232),
[SPF](https://www.godaddy.com/en-ca/help/add-an-spf-record-19218),
[CNAME](https://www.godaddy.com/en-ca/help/add-a-cname-record-19236),
[SRV](https://www.godaddy.com/en-ca/help/add-an-srv-record-19216).

What the docs + screenshot establish and we encoded:

- The add-record dialog is a **single form** with a **Type** dropdown (like `bunny`
  / `spaceship`, not per-type sections like Cosmotown). Path: **Domain Portfolio →
  domain → DNS → DNS Records → Add New Record**.
- **Name** is entered as **`@` for the root domain** (GoDaddy uses `@`, not a blank
  field — the `{host}` pattern, unlike bunny/cosmotown's blank apex).
- **MX** has a separate **Priority** field; **Value** is the mail host alone.
- **SRV** is the most decomposed of any provider: the form breaks the
  `_service._protocol` label into separate **Service** (`_jmap`) and **Protocol**
  (`_tcp`) fields, plus **Name** (`@` at the apex), **Value** (target), and separate
  **Priority / Weight / Port**. This is the first provider to need it, so it added
  `{service}` / `{protocol}` / `{srvhost}` tokens to the shared interpreter in
  **both** `verify_thundermail_dns.py` and `app.js` (derived by splitting the SRV
  host label on `.`; kept in sync per CLAUDE.md).
- **SPF** is added as a plain **TXT** record (GoDaddy's SPF help article is just a
  TXT with an SPF value), so it uses the TXT field set.
- The provider headers carry an `UNVERIFIED —` prefix so CLI/web users see the
  caveat inline.

Still **unverified** against a live end-to-end add: the exact MX/TXT/CNAME field
labels (only the SRV form was screenshotted), and whether any target Value needs a
trailing dot. To promote: add one record of each type on a live GoDaddy-hosted
domain, confirm 13/13 via `--resolver <the domain's GoDaddy authoritative NS>`, then
drop the `UNVERIFIED` prefixes in `records.json` and the notes here and in
[`README.md`](README.md).

### `ionos` (ionos.com) — unverified

Added 2026-07-16 for internal ticket 6911 (`6911_IONOS_DNS_REDACTED_DOT_COM`,
domain `ionos.example.com`). Marked **unverified**: the conventions come from six IONOS
help articles plus a screenshot of the live **SRV** add-record form, but haven't been
confirmed end-to-end by adding all 13 records on a live IONOS-hosted domain. Sources
(IONOS Help): *Using a Domain with Another Provider's Mail Servers (Editing MX
Records)*, *Managing TXT Records*, *Managing SRV Records*, *Configuring a DMARC Record
for a Domain*, *Configuring a CNAME Record for a Subdomain*, *Using IONOS SPF to
Improve Email Delivery*.

What the docs + screenshot establish and we encoded:

- The add-record dialog is a **single form** with a **Type** dropdown (like `godaddy`
  / `bunny` / `spaceship`, not per-type sections like Cosmotown). Path: **Domains & SSL
  → gear next to the domain → DNS → ADD RECORD**.
- **Host name** is entered as **`@` for the root domain** for MX/TXT (the `{host}`
  pattern, not blank like bunny/cosmotown).
- **MX** has a separate **Priority** field; **Points to** is the mail host alone.
- **SRV** is decomposed like GoDaddy — the form splits `_service._protocol` into
  **Service** (`_jmap`) and **Protocol** fields — but with two IONOS-specific twists:
  (1) **Protocol is a `TCP`/`UDP`/`TLS` dropdown**, so `{protocol}` (which yields
  `_tcp`) would not match an option; it is **hard-coded to `TCP`** because all five
  checked SRV records are `_tcp`. (2) The form has both a **Host name** (record
  location → `{srvhost}`, `@` at the apex) and a separate **Points to** (target),
  one field more than GoDaddy's SRV form. This reuses the `{service}` / `{srvhost}`
  tokens already added for `godaddy`, so no interpreter change was needed.
- **SPF** is a plain **TXT** record. IONOS enables its own "IONOS SPF" by default and
  may already have added a TXT (`v=spf1 include:_spf-us.ionos.com ~all`); the TXT
  header notes that the user must replace/merge it so only one SPF record remains.
- **CNAME** is reached via **Manage Subdomains → gear on the subdomain → DNS** (not the
  main DNS tab), and its fields are labelled **Hostname** / **Point to** (vs
  **Host name** / **Points to** elsewhere); the target is entered without a trailing dot.
- The provider headers carry an `UNVERIFIED —` prefix so CLI/web users see the caveat
  inline.

Still **unverified** against a live end-to-end add: the exact MX/TXT/CNAME field labels
(only the SRV form was screenshotted), the SRV Protocol dropdown values, and whether any
target needs a trailing dot. To promote: `ionos.example.com` is already correctly
configured on IONOS, so confirm 13/13 with `verify_thundermail_dns.py ionos.example.com`,
eyeball the emitted `ionos` fix strings against the live panel, then drop the
`UNVERIFIED` prefixes in `records.json` and the notes here and in
[`README.md`](README.md).

### `ovh` (ovhcloud.com) — unverified

Added 2026-07-16 for internal ticket 6837 (`6837_OVH_DNS_PROVIDER_REDACTED`, sample domain
`ovh.example.com`). Marked **unverified**: the conventions come from three OVHcloud help articles
plus a screenshot of the live **TXT/SPF** add-entry wizard, but the **MX** and **SRV**
wizard field layouts were not screenshotted and haven't been confirmed end-to-end. Sources
(OVHcloud Documentation): *Editing an OVHcloud DNS zone*
(docs.ovhcloud.com/en/guides/web-cloud/domains/dns-zone-edit), *Everything you need to know
about DNS zone*, *How to improve email security with an SPF record*
(docs.ovhcloud.com/en/guides/web-cloud/domains/dns-zone-spf).

What the docs + screenshot establish and we encoded:

- Records are added through a **3-step "Add an entry to the DNS zone" wizard** reached from
  the DNS zone table (**Web Cloud → DNS zones → domain → DNS zone → Add an entry**), not a
  flat single form. Step 1 picks the type (A/AAAA/NS/CNAME; CAA/TXT/NAPTR/SRV/…;
  MX/SPF/DKIM/DMARC).
- **Apex Sub-domain is left empty** — the wizard shows the `.yourdomain` suffix beside the
  field and appends it automatically (the `{subhost}` pattern, like bunny/cosmotown, not
  `@`).
- ⚠️ **FQDN targets need a trailing dot.** The docs are explicit for CNAME/URL targets ("if
  you do not punctuate it, your domain name will be automatically added to the end"), so all
  `ovh` MX/SRV/CNAME targets are emitted with a trailing `.` (encoded as `{target}.`). OVH
  is the first provider to require this. The CNAME dot is documented; the MX/SRV dot is
  inferred from the same rule and still needs live confirmation.
- **SRV keeps the `_service._protocol` label combined** in Sub-domain (`{host}`, e.g.
  `_jmap._tcp`) — OVH does **not** split Service/Protocol like `godaddy`/`ionos`, so the
  existing tokens suffice and **no interpreter change was needed**.
- **SPF** uses the plain **TXT** path; the header steers users away from OVH's "Add an
  OVHcloud SPF record" button (which injects `include:mx.ovh.com`).
- The provider headers carry an `UNVERIFIED —` prefix so CLI/web users see the caveat
  inline.

Still **unverified** against a live end-to-end add: the exact **MX** and **SRV** wizard
field labels (only the TXT/SPF wizard was screenshotted), whether the SRV wizard uses
separate Priority/Weight/Port/Target fields, and whether MX/SRV targets truly need the
trailing dot. To promote: `ovh.example.com` is already correctly configured on OVH, so confirm 13/13
with `verify_thundermail_dns.py ovh.example.com` (or `--resolver ns200.anycast.me`), eyeball the
emitted `ovh` fix strings against the live panel, then drop the `UNVERIFIED` prefixes in
`records.json` and the notes here and in [`README.md`](README.md).
