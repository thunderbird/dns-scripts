# Release notes

Chronological record of provider-remediation support added to `dns-scripts`. Each
provider is pure data in [`records.json`](records.json); both front-ends (the
`verify_thundermail_dns.py` CLI and the `index.html`/`app.js` web app) pick it up
automatically. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the onboarding workflow
and the verification bar every provider is held to.

## ⚠️ Pending verification

**`spaceship` is unverified.** To promote it (do this when you have a live Spaceship
panel open):

1. Open the panel and click **+ Add record** for one record of each type
   (MX / SRV / TXT / CNAME) — the *manual* form, not the zone-import preview.
2. Confirm three things:
   - The exact field labels in the add form (is it `Host` or `Hostname`? etc.).
   - **SRV host** — does the form want it as one field (`_caldavs._tcp`, what we
     ship) or split into service + protocol (`_caldavs` + `_tcp`, as the import
     preview showed)?
   - Whether CNAME/MX targets need a trailing dot (the import preview stored one).
3. Fix `records.json` if anything differs, then remove the `UNVERIFIED —` prefixes
   from the four `spaceship` headers, and delete the unverified notes in
   [`README.md`](README.md) and the `spaceship` section below.

Details and reasoning are in the [`spaceship` notes](#spaceship-spaceshipcom--unverified).

## Notes

### `bunny` (bunny.net)

Added 2026-07-13. First drafted from a record-list screenshot (the `bunny.example.com`
zone), then **corrected and verified** the same day against bunny.net's official
docs ([DNS records](https://docs.bunny.net/docs/dns-records)). The confirmed
conventions:

- The add-record dialog is a **single form** with a **Type** dropdown (not per-type
  sections like Cosmotown) and fields **Hostname / Type / TTL / Value**.
- **Hostname** is left **empty for the root domain** (the `subhost` pattern) — never
  `@`; bunny lists apex records under the full domain name.
- There is **one Value field with no separate Priority / Weight / Port fields**, so
  MX and SRV put the whole record string in Value (`{match}`) — e.g. MX
  `10 mail.thundermail.com`, SRV `0 1 443 mail.thundermail.com`. The record-list
  screenshot corroborated this (MX displayed as `10 mail.thundermail.com`).
- The record list's **Weight** column is bunny's A/AAAA load-balancing "Routing
  Weight" (0-100, under Advanced Settings), **not** the SRV weight — so it does not
  factor into any of the Thundermail records.

Corrections made from the initial screenshot-only draft: the field is **Hostname**
(not "Name"); MX/SRV use a single **Value** (not separate Priority/Weight/Port);
dropped the unverified CNAME "no trailing dot" note.

**Live validation (2026-07-13):** ran the CLI against the real bunny.net-hosted
`bunny.example.com` (delegated to `kiki`/`coco.bunny.net`) → **13/13 passed, exit 0**.
Driven by Zendesk ticket [6750](https://tbpro.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/6750).
Every value bunny.net serves matches the expected strings byte-for-byte, including
`MX 10 mail.thundermail.com` and `SRV 0 1 443 mail.thundermail.com` — confirming the
single-`Value`-field (`{match}`) remediation produces exactly what the panel stores.

### `spaceship` (spaceship.com) — unverified

Added 2026-07-13 for Zendesk ticket
[6672](https://tbpro.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/6672). Marked **unverified** because
the two sources only partly cover it:

- A **zone-import preview** screenshot from the real `cosmotown.example.com` zone
  (CONTRIBUTING artifact type 2, and specifically the *import* view — not the
  higher-priority manual add-record form, type 1).
- Spaceship's official docs
  ([Required DNS records for Spacemail](https://www.spaceship.com/knowledgebase/spacemail-dns-records-third-party-domain/)),
  which document **Spacemail's own** records (`mx1.spacemail.com`, …), a *different*
  record set — so they confirm the panel's column labels but not the Thundermail
  entries.

What the sources agree on and we encoded:

- Columns are **Host / Type / Value / TTL** (docs call Host "Hostname"); the panel
  auto-appends the domain to Host and uses **`@` for the root** (not blank).
- **MX** has a separate **Priority** field alongside the target Value.
- **SRV** breaks out **Priority / Weight / Port / Target** as separate fields.
- The provider headers themselves carry an `UNVERIFIED` prefix so CLI/web users see
  the caveat inline.

Still **unverified** against a live manual add-record form:

- Exact field labels in the *add* form (vs. the import preview).
- **SRV host**: the import view split it into `_caldavs` + `_tcp` (service +
  protocol) fields; we encoded the combined `_caldavs._tcp` (matching the docs'
  single `_autodiscover._tcp` hostname). Confirm which the add form expects.
- Whether CNAME/MX targets need a trailing dot (the import view showed them stored
  with one).

To promote to verified: capture the manual add-record form for one record of each
type, confirm the field sets, then drop the `UNVERIFIED` prefixes in `records.json`
and the note here and in [`README.md`](README.md).
