## Thundermail DNS checker — web version

**<https://thunderbird.github.io/dns-scripts/>**

The same checks as the `verify_thundermail_dns.py` CLI below, but from a web
browser: enter a domain, optionally pick your DNS provider, and get pass/fail per
record plus exactly what to enter for any that are missing. All lookups run
client-side via DNS-over-HTTPS (Cloudflare or Google) — no server, nothing stored.

Run it locally with any static file server:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000   # then open http://localhost:8000/
```

> **Single source of truth:** the record set, value templates, and per-provider
> remediation strings live in [`records.json`](records.json), which is read by
> *both* the CLI and the web page (`index.html` + `app.js`). Add a record or a
> provider there once and both front-ends pick it up.

## Setup

Managed with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```sh
uv sync
```

## verify_thundermail_dns.py

Verifies that a domain's DNS is configured for [Thundermail](https://thundermail.com):
the MX record, the JMAP/CalDAV/CardDAV/IMAPS/submission SRV records, the SPF /
MTA-STS / TLSRPT / DMARC TXT records, and the three DKIM CNAMEs.

```sh
uv run verify_thundermail_dns.py glamrocnamecheap.com
```

Exit status is `0` only when every expected record is present and correct, so it's
safe to use in scripts or CI. **SRV is the one type checked relationally rather than
against a literal.** Port and target must match exactly, but the **weight is not
compared at all** (it only distributes load between competing targets at the same
priority, and Thundermail publishes a single target per service — while some panels,
e.g. Plesk / METANET, offer only a fixed dropdown of weights in steps of 5), and the
**priority only has to be a lower number than any other target at that name**. So a
working setup at priority `10` passes, and a record that's published but *tied with or
out-ranked by* a competing target is reported as a **conflict** — it exists, but it may
not win. The recommended values are `priority 0`, `weight 0` (both the lowest). See
[#14](https://github.com/thunderbird/dns-scripts/issues/14) and
[thunderbird-accounts#1163](https://github.com/thunderbird/thunderbird-accounts/issues/1163).
It queries `1.1.1.1` by default (override with
`--resolver` or the `DNS_RESOLVER` environment variable) to avoid stale local
caches. The resolver accepts an IP address or a hostname — e.g. point it at an
authoritative nameserver to bypass public-resolver caching entirely:

```sh
uv run verify_thundermail_dns.py glamrocnamecheap.com --resolver dns1.registrar-servers.com
```

Point it at whichever nameserver is actually authoritative for the domain — check
with `dig NS <domain>` first, since a registrar may run several nameserver sets and
querying the wrong one just returns empty answers. For example, a domain hosted on
Cosmotown's DNS is usually delegated to `ndns1.cosmotown.com` / `ndns2.cosmotown.com`
([Cosmotown: What are Cosmotown's nameservers?](https://cosmotown.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/214830046-How-to-change-your-Nameservers-What-are-Cosmotown-s-Nameservers)):

```sh
uv run verify_thundermail_dns.py <domain> --resolver ndns1.cosmotown.com
```

A domain hosted on Bunny DNS is delegated to `kiki.bunny.net` / `coco.bunny.net`
([bunny.net: DNS records](https://docs.bunny.net/docs/dns-records)):

```sh
uv run verify_thundermail_dns.py <domain> --resolver kiki.bunny.net
```

### Fixing failures

Pass `--provider` to print, for each **failing** record, exactly what to enter in
that DNS provider's control panel — including provider-specific quirks such as how
the Host/Name field is written. Supported: `namecheap`, `squarespace`, `cosmotown`,
`bunny`, `spaceship`, `godaddy`, `ionos`, `ovh`, `hover`, `digitalocean`, `porkbun`,
`metanet-plesk`, `cloudflare`, `generic`. bunny.net's add-record form has a single
**Value** field (no separate Priority/Weight/Port), so the `bunny` MX/SRV output puts
the whole record string in Value; the Hostname field is left empty for the root
([bunny.net: DNS records](https://docs.bunny.net/docs/dns-records)). **`spaceship`
is unverified** — its field conventions were inferred from a zone-import screenshot
and Spaceship's own Spacemail docs (a different record set), not confirmed against
the live manual add-record form, so its headers flag this and the SRV host handling
is uncertain (see [`RELEASE_NOTES.md`](RELEASE_NOTES.md)). **`godaddy` is also
unverified** — its field conventions come from GoDaddy's help docs plus a screenshot
of the live SRV add-record form, not yet confirmed end-to-end on a live GoDaddy-hosted
domain, so its headers flag this. GoDaddy is the one panel that splits the SRV
`_service._protocol` label into separate **Service** and **Protocol** fields
(the record Name is then `@` for the root). **`ionos` is also unverified** — its
field conventions come from IONOS's help docs plus a screenshot of the live SRV
add-record form, not yet confirmed end-to-end on a live IONOS-hosted domain, so its
headers flag this. IONOS also splits the SRV `_service._protocol` label, but its
Protocol is a `TCP`/`UDP`/`TLS` dropdown (hard-coded to `TCP`, since every checked
SRV record is `_tcp`), and its SRV form has both a **Host name** (record location)
and a separate **Points to** (target). **`ovh` is also unverified** — its field
conventions come from OVHcloud's help docs plus a screenshot of the live TXT/SPF
add-entry wizard, not yet confirmed end-to-end (the MX/SRV wizards weren't
screenshotted), so its headers flag this. OVH's quirks: the **Sub-domain** field is
left **empty** for the root (not `@`), and FQDN **targets need a trailing dot** (OVH
appends your domain otherwise), so the `ovh` MX/SRV/CNAME output ends targets with a
`.`. **`hover` is also unverified** — its SRV field layout comes from a screenshot of
the live *Edit DNS Record* form, but the MX/TXT/CNAME field labels come from Hover's
[Managing DNS Records at Hover](https://support.hover.com/support/solutions/articles/) docs
(not a live add-record screenshot), so its headers flag this. Hover splits the SRV
`_service._protocol` label into separate **Service** and **Protocol** fields (like GoDaddy/IONOS),
but its optional **Subdomain** field is left **empty** for the root (not `@` — the `hover`
SRV output uses a blank subdomain, driven by a `{srvsubhost}` token); MX/TXT use `@` for the
root. **`digitalocean` is also unverified** — its SRV field layout comes from a screenshot
of the live *Create a record* dialog, while the MX/TXT/CNAME field labels come from
DigitalOcean's [Create, Edit, and Delete DNS Records](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/dns/how-to/manage-records/)
docs (not a live add-record screenshot), so its headers flag this. DigitalOcean keeps the
whole SRV `_service._protocol` label in one **Hostname** field (it does *not* split it like
GoDaddy/IONOS/Hover), uses `@` for the root (MX/TXT), and **appends your domain to any
target entered without a trailing dot** — so the `digitalocean` MX/SRV/CNAME output ends
targets with a `.` (like `ovh`). This trailing-dot behaviour is confirmed live on
`digitalocean.example.com`, whose SRV targets were entered without the dot and came back as
`mail.thundermail.com.digitalocean.example.com`. **`porkbun` is also unverified** — its MX/TXT/CNAME
field layout comes from Porkbun's KB article
[How to Add DNS Records](https://kb.porkbun.com/article/231-how-to-add-dns-records-on-porkbun)
and its SRV layout from the
[SRV record guide](https://kb.porkbun.com/article/109-how-to-create-an-srv-record)
(screenshots, but not confirmed end-to-end on a live panel), so its headers flag this.
Porkbun (Cloudflare-backed) uses a single Add-record dialog with a Type dropdown: the
**Host** field is left **blank** for the root (not `@`), MX and SRV have a separate
**Priority** field, and SRV keeps the whole `_service._protocol` label in one Host with
Weight/Port/Target packed into the Answer field. Unlike `ovh`/`digitalocean`, targets do
**not** need a trailing dot — confirmed live on `porkbun.example.com`, whose MX and DKIM CNAME
targets came back verbatim (Porkbun stores them as entered). **`metanet-plesk` is also
unverified** — it covers [METANET](https://www.metanet.ch/)'s **Plesk** DNS panel
(*Websites & Domains → DNS-Einstellungen → Eintrag hinzufügen*), whose SRV field layout
is confirmed from a screenshot of the live form on a METANET-hosted zone, while the
German MX/CNAME field labels come from Plesk's docs rather than a live add-record form,
so its headers flag this
([METANET: Plesk DNS-Verwaltung](https://www.metanet.ch/de/support/dns-nameserver/dns/plesk-dns-verwaltung)).
The panel is **German-language**, so the emitted field labels are German with an English
gloss (`Zielhost (Target host)`). Plesk's quirks: `Domainname` is left **empty** for the
root (never `@`); it splits the SRV label into **Service-Name** and **Protokoll** like
GoDaddy/IONOS/Hover but wants them **without the leading underscore** (`imaps`, `tcp` —
the `{bareservice}`/`{bareprotocol}` tokens exist for this); **Priorität** and **Relative
Gewichtung** are dropdowns rather than free text, and the weight dropdown only offers
0/5/10…50 — the recommended weight of `0` is the `niedrig (0)` entry, and any weight
passes the check anyway (the dropdown is what prompted
[#14](https://github.com/thunderbird/dns-scripts/issues/14));
targets are stored **verbatim with no trailing dot** (Plesk adds the root dot itself —
confirmed live); TXT values are **auto-quoted** by the panel, so they're emitted
unquoted (like `cosmotown`); and nothing goes live until you click **Aktualisieren**
(Update) on the pending-changes banner. METANET also sells a paid *Premium Service:
Individuelle DNS-Einstellungen* where support enters the records for you — the emitted
headers mention it as a fallback. **`cloudflare`** covers the Cloudflare dashboard (*your domain → DNS → Records →
Add record*), whose field labels were read off live add-record dialogs for all four
types on 2026-08-26
([Cloudflare: manage DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/)).
Its quirks: **Name is `@` for the root** (the field literally placeholders as
“Use @ for root”); the SRV `_service._protocol` label stays **combined** in one Name
field (Cloudflare appends your domain), with **Priority / Weight / Port / Target as four
separate boxes**; targets are stored **verbatim with no trailing dot**; and TXT
**Content must be typed with its surrounding double quotes** — Cloudflare does not add
them, making `cloudflare` the one provider whose TXT value is emitted quoted (the
opposite of `cosmotown`/`metanet-plesk`, which auto-quote). The one that bites people:
the CNAME form defaults **Proxy status** to *Proxied*, which makes Cloudflare answer
with its own addresses instead of the DKIM target and silently breaks DKIM — so the
three DKIM CNAMEs must be set to **DNS only**, and the emitted fix carries that as its
own column. Cloudflare assigns each zone its own nameserver pair, so check
`dig NS <domain>` before using `--resolver <assigned>.ns.cloudflare.com`. Not yet run
end-to-end against a Cloudflare-hosted Thundermail zone. Note that
Cosmotown's customer panel has no SRV section, so the five SRV
records can't be self-served — the `cosmotown` output routes you to Cosmotown support
for those. See Cosmotown's docs for
[changing/saving DNS records](https://cosmotown.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/214829926-How-to-change-and-save-your-DNS-Records),
[adding a host name](https://cosmotown.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/214830006-How-to-add-a-Host-Name-to-your-Domain-name-s-DNS),
and [updating the MX record](https://cosmotown.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/214830106-How-to-update-the-MX-Record).

```sh
uv run verify_thundermail_dns.py glamrocnamecheap.com --provider namecheap
```

For example, a missing DKIM CNAME prints:

```
• CNAME tm1._domainkey
  Namecheap → Advanced DNS → Add New Record → CNAME Record:
      Host:   tm1._domainkey
      Target: tm1.glamrocnamecheap.com.dkim.thunderhosted.com   (no trailing dot)
```

### Example

```
Verifying Thundermail DNS for glamrocnamecheap.com (resolver 1.1.1.1)

MX:
  OK   @                                              10 mail.thundermail.com
SRV:
  OK   _jmap._tcp                                     0 0 443 mail.thundermail.com
  ...

Result: 13 passed, 0 failed.
```
