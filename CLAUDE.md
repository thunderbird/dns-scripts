# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working in this repository.

## Purpose

`dns-scripts` verifies that a domain's DNS matches the **Thundermail**
(thundermail.com) email setup and, when records are missing/wrong, prints exactly
what to enter in a given DNS provider's control panel. It ships as **two
front-ends over one data file**:

- **CLI** — `verify_thundermail_dns.py` (Python, run via `uv`).
- **Web** — `index.html` + `app.js`, a static page that does all lookups in the
  browser via DNS-over-HTTPS. Hosted on GitHub Pages:
  **https://thunderbird.github.io/dns-scripts/**

The checked set is 13 records: 1 MX, 5 SRV (jmap/caldavs/carddavs/imaps/submission),
4 TXT (SPF / MTA-STS / TLSRPT / DMARC), 3 DKIM CNAMEs.

## Core architecture & crucial decisions

- **Single source of truth = `records.json`.** It holds the record set,
  `value_templates` (how each type's expected/full value string is built), and the
  per-provider remediation strings (`namecheap`, `squarespace`, `cosmotown`,
  `generic`). BOTH
  front-ends read it, so they can never drift. **Add a record or a provider once in
  `records.json` and both the CLI and the web app pick it up** — do not hardcode
  records/strings in the Python or JS.
- **Each front-end keeps only a tiny interpreter** (~20 lines): an `interpolate`
  (`{field}` token substitution), a `resolve_record`/`resolveRecord` (fills
  `{domain}`, computes `qname`/`fqdn`, and `subhost` = the host label but empty at
  the apex, for panels like Cosmotown whose Host field is left blank — not `@` —
  for the root domain), and one platform-specific DNS-query
  function — dnspython (CLI) vs a DoH `fetch` (web). These are intentionally
  duplicated in Python and JS; keep them in sync. The **hostname-validation regex**
  is likewise duplicated in both — keep it identical.
- **Interpolation contract (both languages, must match):** substitute `{domain}`
  into every string field first; then `{field}` tokens in templates resolve against
  the concrete record. `re.sub`/`String.replace` use a **function** replacement so
  values are inserted literally (no second pass).
- **Web lookups use public DoH** (Cloudflare `cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query` with
  `accept: application/dns-json`, or Google `dns.google/resolve`). Public resolvers
  cache negative answers, so a freshly-added record can lag; the **CLI can query an
  authoritative NS directly** to bypass: `--resolver dns1.registrar-servers.com`
  (Namecheap). **Check the domain's actual delegation first** (`dig NS <domain>`) —
  Cosmotown, for example, runs two nameserver families: `ns1..ns4.cosmotown.com`
  (Cloudflare-fronted) and `ndns1`/`ndns2.cosmotown.com` (AWS). A domain lives on
  only one; querying the wrong one returns `REFUSED` (shows up as `<empty>` for
  every record). Cosmotown example: `--resolver ndns1.cosmotown.com`
  ([Cosmotown: nameservers](https://cosmotown.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/214830046-How-to-change-your-Nameservers-What-are-Cosmotown-s-Nameservers)).
- **Provider field conventions were verified against each provider's docs, not
  guessed** (e.g. Namecheap splits SRV into Host/Priority/Weight/Port/Target;
  Squarespace uses Name + a separate Priority + `Data` = "weight port target").
  Provider menu wording may drift — re-verify if a user reports it's off.
  `cosmotown` was verified against a live panel (cosmotown.example.com). Its quirks:
  records are grouped into per-type sections each with its own `+ Quick Add`
  (so there's no Type field); columns are `Priority`/`Host`/`Points to` (MX),
  `Host`/`Points to` (CNAME), `Host`/`TXT Value` (TXT); MX Host is left blank for
  the root and the panel auto-fills the domain; the CNAME `Points to` is stored
  with a trailing dot automatically; TXT values are wrapped in quotes by the panel
  and are case-sensitive; and **there is no SRV section at all** — the SRV block
  routes the user to Cosmotown support instead. Docs:

## Security posture

Reviewed; no exploitable injection/XSS/RCE. Defense-in-depth already in place —
preserve it when editing:

- **Web renders only via `textContent`** (never `innerHTML`) and builds DoH URLs
  with `encodeURIComponent`. A **CSP `<meta>`** locks `script-src 'self'` and
  `connect-src` to the two DoH hosts + self. Don't introduce inline scripts,
  `eval`, or `innerHTML` (they'd need CSP changes and reopen XSS).
- **CLI** escapes control/terminal bytes from DNS-derived output (`sanitize`),
  validates the domain against a hostname regex before any lookup (exit 2 on
  invalid), and caps displayed answer length.
- `--resolver` / `DNS_RESOLVER` are trusted (operator-controlled), out of scope.

## Commands

```sh
uv sync                                   # one-time / after dep changes

# CLI
uv run verify_thundermail_dns.py <domain>
uv run verify_thundermail_dns.py glamrocnamecheap.com --provider namecheap
uv run verify_thundermail_dns.py <domain> --resolver dns1.registrar-servers.com

# Web (static — any file server)
python3 -m http.server 8000               # then open http://localhost:8000/
```

Exit status is `0` only when all 13 records are present and correct.

## Testing

- **CLI regression:** normal-input output should stay byte-identical across
  refactors. Capture `glamrocnamecheap.com` (expect 13/13, exit 0) and
  `example.com --provider namecheap|squarespace|cosmotown|generic` before a change, then
  `diff` after. Also test invalid/malicious domains → rejected with exit 2.
- **Fix layout:** `--provider` fixes default to a compact per-type table (one
  column per provider field, one row per failing record); `--fix-format long`
  gives the older one-labelled-block-per-record layout. The web app mirrors this
  with the "Fix format" selector (Table/Detailed). Both are driven off the same
  `providers.<name>.<TYPE>.fields` in `records.json` — keep the two renderers in
  sync. When capturing a CLI baseline, pin `--fix-format` so the diff is stable.
- **Web headless (Playwright):** this repo has no Playwright dependency; run it
  from an env that does. Serve the site, then drive it. **The CSP (`script-src
  'self'`, no `unsafe-eval`) blocks Playwright's `page.wait_for_function`** — poll
  `page.inner_text('#summary')` in a loop instead. Confirm no console errors and no
  CSP violations (that verifies DoH + `records.json` requests aren't blocked).

## Deployment

GitHub Pages, source = `main` branch root, at
`https://thunderbird.github.io/dns-scripts/`. GitHub Pages can't set HTTP headers,
so the CSP is delivered as a `<meta http-equiv>` tag in `index.html`.
